Making A New Page
=================
After I had created and configured my sphinx project, I was keen to add new pages to it, in order to relay information
as I was learning about it.
The way in which pages are added in sphinx are split in to two parts:

1. Creating the page
2. Adding this to the toc tree

Creating the Page
"""""""""""""""""
The first step to creating a new page in sphinx is to open a new tab in your preferred text editor (at current I
personally use notepad++) and save this as a '.rst' file. This is done through saving the extension of the page as 
'.txt' but adding '.rst' to the name of the page. The main convention to naming new pages is to be concise, and where 
the page name is multiple words, the words should be separated by hyphens ('-').

Adding the Page
"""""""""""""""
Once the file has been created, in order to create the html from the rst file, sphinx has to know where this file
should be referenced and how to reach it.

Within the 'index.rst' file, there is a toc-tre, which is included in the sidebar of the html page, used for
navigation. To add a page, simply write the text you wish to appear in the navigation bar, followed by a space, and
the file name (not including .rst) of the file you wish to reference contained within <>.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

	.. toctree::
	:maxdepth: 2
	:caption: Contents:

	My Next Page <next-page>
