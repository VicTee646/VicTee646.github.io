Configuring a Sphinx Project
============================
Now I've decided that I want to create a Sphinx document, how do I get started?

The first step is to ensure that you have sphinx downloaded in the environment that you are working in for this
project, or simply the base environment if you are not creating a new environment.

Open your anaconda prompt, and type:

.. code-block:: python

	pip install sphinx
	
Once this is installed, go in to the directory in which you wish to save your sphinx documents 

.. code-block:: python
	
	cd sphinx-docs
	
Now run the following command

.. code-block:: python

	sphinx-quickstart
	
Now, a series of questions will appear, allowing you to configure your individual project. I will go through each option, and discuss the outcomes of each.
